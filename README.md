## Tower of Hanoi (GUI)
This is a mini python program that will set up disks and implement the well-known recursive algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.

### History
I initially wrote this program as an assignment for one of the courses I was studying at Uni. (Namely, Data Structures and Algorithms). In the class flashy GUI is not given the priority, rather the data structures and algorithms, so forgive my GUI.

### Usage
1. Run main.py
2. If the workings of the program doesn't suit you, or you need/want to change graphic components like colors, fonts, number of rods, height and width of the tkinter window, and more, you will likely need to make your changes to the <im>commons.py</im> file.
3. Of course, you can compile it all into one .exe or .f file, for whatever reasons, using <strong>pytelegraminstaller</strong>.
