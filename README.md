## Tower of Hanoi
This is a mini python program that will set up disks and implement a well-known recursive algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem.

### History
I initially wrote this program for an assignment in one of my classes in my study (Namely, Data Structures and Algorithms). In the class flashy GUI is not given the priority rather the data structures and algorithms, so forgive my GUI.

### Usage
1. Run main.py
2. If the workings of the program doesn't suit you, or you need/want to change things like colors, fonts, number of rods, height and width of the tkinter window, and more, you will likely need to make your changes to the <im>commons.py</im> file.
